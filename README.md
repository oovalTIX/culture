# Master Plan
**Mission:** Expand the capabilities of event organizers through tech-forward ticketing

## Vision
OOVAL's vision is to revolutionize the concept of ticketing by 1) transforming the ticket into an access token with unlimited potential and 2) providing the infrastructure powering this revolution. 

## Core values
1. Set Audacious Goals & Be Fearless
2. Product First & Client Focused
3. Championship Mindset

## Philosophy
We are individuals who strive to make a significant impact on the world - who aim to be high achievers. Our goal is not to attract applicants who seek to reduce their workload or maximize their pay. While there are plenty of high-paying and comfortable jobs available, they do not align with our values. We foster a culture that fosters exceptional performance and motivates us to operate at our optimal level each day.

We are tech-forward and the first-of-its-kind ticketing technology company.

Simultaneously, we will continuously strive to avoid corporate bloating - as this has been a historical problem in ticketing and the live-entertainment industry.  As becoming overly bureaucratic could lead to a decline in morale and ultimately harm the business. It is imperative that we maintain our focus to accomplish our mission. The company is committed to acting in the best interest of humanity, behaving ethically, and treating others fairly. We will not endorse social activism, presume negative intentions, treat others unjustly, or engage in causes beyond our primary objective. Our singular goal is to deliver a meaningful and practical product to the market.

## The road ahead

As we enter an era of unprecedented technological advancements, such as blockchain-based markets and advanced AI, having a cutting-edge ticketing engine that can strategically leverage these technologies is crucial to creating a better future. We envision a future where event organizers can run thriving businesses, fans can buy tickets without any hassle, and governments do not need to intervene at every step of the way.

Therefore, OOVAL's goal is to develop a ticketing infrastructure that is ready for the requirements of modern events. With advanced inventory management capabilities and a highly customizable framework, event organizers can finally focus on creating the ultimate experience for their fans, rather than being constrained by current limitations.

This is audacious goal. This is where we thrive. GO!
