## Vision
OOVAL's vision is to revolutionize the concept of ticketing by

1) transforming the ticket into a programmable access token with unlimited potential and 
2) providing the infrastructure powering this revolution. 

## Values
1. Set Audacious Goals & Be Fearless
2. Product First & Client Focused
3. Championship Mindset

## Coding-principles

First principle:
- `Use technology for maximum leverage and gain optimal results.`
- Translated into practice this means `not doing something manually, if a tool can do it better than me`

To the best of our abilities, we are coding in the most `minimal`, `efficient` and `clearest` way possible. Clear documentation is paramount. Respecting the coding style is non-negociable.

## Dream

In this era of unprecedented technological advancements such as blockchain-based markets and advanced AI, a cutting-edge ticketing engine strategically positioned to utilize them can pave the way for a future where fans can buy and trade tickets with confidence, organizers can thrive, and governments do not have to intervene at every step of the way in the ticketing industry to ensure a fair market.

## Philosophy
We are individuals who strive to make a significant impact on the world - high achievers constantly challenging the status quo.

Our goal is not to attract applicants who seek to reduce their workload or maximize their pay. While there are plenty of high-paying and comfortable jobs available, they do not align with our values. We foster a culture that fosters exceptional performance and motivates us to operate at our optimal level each day.

We are tech-forward and the first-of-its-kind ticketing technology company.

Simultaneously, we will continuously strive to avoid corporate bloating - as this has been a historical problem in ticketing and the live-entertainment industry.  As becoming overly bureaucratic could lead to a decline in morale and ultimately harm the business. It is imperative that we maintain our focus to accomplish our mission. The company is committed to acting in the best interest of humanity, behaving ethically, and treating others fairly. We will not endorse social activism, presume negative intentions, treat others unjustly, or engage in causes beyond our primary objective. Our singular goal is to deliver a meaningful and practical product to the market.

## Road-ahead

Ticketing has remained largely unchanged since the days of the Colosseum 2000 years ago. Today, the industry faces problems because it has tried for almost 50 years to adapt outdated, physics-limited, stone-based tickets to the digital era. Our vision is to transform tickets from basic access tokens to programmable gateways that unlock a complete universe of experiences, whether physical or digital.

Imagine being an organizer with the ability to indefinetly extend the lifetime of a ticket and reach fans far beyond the event itself thorugh specific activations. With some simple math, by selling 1 million programmable tickets per while controlling the primary and resale markets, you could reach more than 100 million fans in 10 years - and this connection can be kept alive indefinitely.

Our ticketing engine is designed for unlimited flexbility to address the challenges of the modern Live-Entertainment industry. Technology has no intrinsic value by itself, if the user experience is lacking. This is why we aim for a seamless developer & user experience by combining the blockchain infrastructure and AI capabiltities with versatile, developer-friendly APIs. The entire complexity and granularity are abstracted, making everything possible at an API call distance.


## Conclusion

Ticketing is at a crossroads, with incredible potential but also significant challenges to overcome. It is crucially important that we plan accordingly to address these challenges and take advantage of the opportunities ahead.

This is audacious goal. Time to build.
